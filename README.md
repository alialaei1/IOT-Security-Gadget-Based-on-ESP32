# IOT-Security-Gadget-Based-on-ESP32

is a smart security system designed to detect any unauthorized entry into a home and alert the homeowner via MQTT Protocol  and call to their mobile phone. The system is built using an ESP32 microcontroller and Tasmota firmware.

ESP32 is a powerful microcontroller that's commonly used in IoT projects due to its low cost, low power consumption, and built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity. The ESP32 can be used to process data from various sensors and modules, making it a perfect choice for a home security system.

Tasmota firmware is an open-source firmware for ESP8266 and ESP32-based devices that provides a web interface for configuration and control of the device. It's designed to be easy to use and highly configurable, making it a popular choice for DIY IoT projects.

The IoT home security alarm system can be equipped with various sensors, such as PIR motion sensors, door and window sensors, and temperature and humidity sensors. These sensors can be used to detect motion, changes in temperature and humidity levels, and unauthorized access to doors and windows.

The ESP32 microcontroller can process the data from these sensors and trigger an audible alarm based on the data. For example, if the PIR motion sensor detects motion, the system can trigger an audible alarm to alert the user.

The system can also be integrated with other smart home devices, such as smart lights and smart locks. This allows the user to control the security system and other smart home devices from a single interface.

Overall, an IoT home security alarm system based on ESP32 and Tasmota is a simple yet effective solution for securing a home network. By leveraging the features of the ESP32 and Tasmota, a custom security system can be developed to meet the specific needs of a home network, helping to keep IoT devices and data safe from potential threats.
